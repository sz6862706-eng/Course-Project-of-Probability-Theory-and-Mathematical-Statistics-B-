Predicting stock prices is very difficult because the market changes constantly and has many complex patterns. This study created a computer system to forecast stock market indices using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The system uses three types of RNN models: basic RNN, LSTM, and GRU. It includes all steps from preparing data to testing results. We collected daily information from 11 major stock markets in China and America. We were careful to use only past data to avoid unfair advantages.We created several technical indicators to help understand market trends. Besides testing single models, we also tried connecting models in different ways to see which works better. We measured success using two methods: how close predictions were to real values and how much computer time and memory each model needed. The study shows how different RNN models compare for stock prediction and helps choose the best balance between accuracy and practical use.
